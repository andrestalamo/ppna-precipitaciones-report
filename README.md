# Net Primary Productivity and Rainfall in the Dry Puna (Cobres, Salta)

This repository hosts **Quarto HTML reports** analyzing the relationship between  
**Net Aboveground Primary Productivity (NAPP)** and rainfall in two shrub steppes  
of the Dry Puna in northwestern Argentina.

## ðŸ“– Context

Livestock production in arid and semi-arid grasslands depends entirely on natural vegetation.  
In the Dry Puna, rainfall is highly variable and strongly determines forage availability.  
These reports explore how vegetation productivity responds to rainfall in two contrasting steppe types:  
a **grassâ€“shrub steppe on slopes** (*Cerro*) and a **shrub-dominated steppe on plains** (*Campo*).  

The analysis connects with classic frameworks such as the *pulseâ€“reserve* and *two-layer* hypotheses (e.g., Ogle & Reynolds, 2004) and provides empirical insights from field data collected in Cobres (Salta, Argentina).
