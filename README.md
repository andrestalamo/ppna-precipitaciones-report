# Quarto Report: Net Primary Productivity and Rainfall in Drylands

This repository hosts an example of a Quarto HTML report inspired by [Yan Holtz](https://www.yan-holtz.com/) courses, pages, and tutorials.  
The report shows a **workflow of statistical analyses and visualizations** applied to ecological grazing data from the Puna Seca region (Argentina).  

It includes:
- Data preparation and analysis in R  
- Statistical models and inference  
- Graphs and tables created with Quarto + ggplot2  
- Example of reproducible reporting for ecological research  

The analyses presented here were part of a study led by **Dr. Mariana Quiroga (INTA, Argentina)** and later used in a manuscript submitted to *EcologÃ­a Austral*.
